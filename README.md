# History of Sanguem Village

Author: Sacchitanand Nadkarni

The name of Sanguem village was not always Sanguem.
In olden times, the village was called Sangam because of the confluence of two rivers at Taripanto.
During the Portuguese rule, the word Sangam was lusophonised into Sanguem.

The village was also not what it is today.
Sanguem village should be brought before the eyes, then from the bridge to the police post and in the middle, after four stops, Boilapar on the right and Taripanto on the left i.e. Sanguem village.
This very area was once completely barren.
While standing in front of Minguelin D'Costa's house after the police post, you can see both the rivers coming from the left side and coming from the Vithoba temple to Taripanto and from the right coming from the Paikdev temple.

<!-- 2 -->

The main river further crossed Radepar and Boilapar and came under the bridge at Taripanto where both the rivers confluence.
It is called the main river because Zuari is one of the two main rivers of Goa.
This river originates in Karnataka and flows from Neturlim to Curpem, Curdi, Salaulim to Paikdev temple.
As the main part of Sanguem is surrounded by both rivers, it was difficult to settle here.
The village was spread to Cotarli, Zariwado, Xelpem, Vorkotto, Piraraj, Temchiwado, Salaulim.
It extended from Uguem to Desaiwado, ?? that was the main part of the village.
Because Desai of Desaiwado as well as Sawant Desai of Xelpem (now living in Valkini) were the rulers of this entire region.
Sawant Desai of Xelpem had an encounter with the Portuguese military (TROPA) near Kharkateghati (now near the Civil Court).
Unfortunately, they could not get timely help from Gauns Desai of Xeldem and many Sawant Desai were killed.

<!-- 3 -->

I had seen the dilapidated mud 'prison' at Desaiwado many years ago.
One of the castles of Uguem is still called Vanyamwado.
While the open maal seen on the way to the chapel is known as Bamanmol.
A family named Kavade lived there.
Mr. Vitthal Salelkar (Bilbab) is his son-in-law.
Later, the daughter of this Salelkar, Rajai, her husband belonged to the same family.
Later this congregation settled in Belgaum.
Vitthal Mashelkar is from Uguem.
The life of Balkrishna Masurkar.
When the Dangui family came here for business, one of their brothers Shri. Vasudev Dangui initially started Ugela Hotel.
The majority of Uguem's population is now Catholic, as much of Uguem's land is owned by Sociedad.
They had also brought some families from Sasashti to work in the land, they have become a populous.
The entire Sanguem taluka was formerly divided into two parts namely Ashtagrihar and Hemadbase.

<!-- 4 -->

Hemadbarse means Sanvordem, Dabal, Dharbandora, Sancordem, Calem, Collem and Curdi, Curpem, Neturlim, Zambaulim, Rivona, Colomba, Vichundrem and Bhati are eight villages together.
We were the managers of Hemadbase and the Nadkarni of Kurpe was in charge of the Ashtagraha.
We lived in Nadkarni Kirlpal - Kodali area.
Kirlpal should be the main place of Hemadbarse.
When you reach Kirlpal village, you can see the remains of the fort.
Later, our ancestors went into three parts. Sakordekar Nadkarni - Sancordem, while Surlkar Nadkarni - Surla - Tambdi Surla - some of these are still to be said.
The remaining ancestors except Sakordekar and Suralkar went to Salaulim.
After a while they fell out of there.
They were two brothers.
One of them, Vyankaji, stayed at Bena and Vithoba went to Sanvordem - that is, today's Savardekar Nadkarni.
There is a big chaff tree in front of our house now.

<!-- 5 -->

Venkaji lived a little further from him.
His two sons.
Abaji and Shabaji.
Abaji is the ancestor of this house and Shabaji of that house.
Abaji's son Rayaji (Rayu) and his son Hiroji (Hiru Shenoy) built this house.
A date is engraved on the threshold of the house, marking the completion of one hundred and forty years of the house.

When there was a big outbreak of fever in Ramnathmol, Piraraj etc., the population came to live in the main part of Sanguem.
This main part now slowly began to take shape.
The area from Payakamand to Vithoba temple is still known as Bazar.
D'Costa residences are opposite Union High School.
This area is still known as Tito.
Tito means market.
Bahushya: Fish Market.
These dictionaries were known as dirty.
They are dirty with oil, so they are dirty.
These scavengers as well as village bakers (poders) used to wear trousers and robes.

<!-- 6 -->

They were called "'Kabay'".
The market used to be held every Wednesday except during the rainy season.
At the end of the Kalutsava of the Vithoba temple, the ferry used to fill up on the Rathutsava, it would stop till the nearest Wednesday and then the Wednesday market would start.
At the church festival at the end of May the ferries remained until the nearest Wednesday, after which the Wednesday market closed and boat traffic resumed at Taripanto.
This boat traffic used to go to Kakutadi on the left side, from there it was possible to go to Solye, Kakoda, Sanvordem via Chikalmol.
Means of transport are bullock cart or boat.
Once upon a time there was a big wood business going on in Sanguem.
On the Nanditirs near the bridge, as well as in Muslimwado, Taripanto, wood was seen wherever there was space.
Such wooded riverside places were called ports.
There were two such ports in Nondurlem area as well.

<!-- 7 -->

A monk used to live in the area between the residences of K. Shantaram Karpe and Mr. Vitthal Govekar. 
He had an idol of Lord Maruti.
At that time, many villagers used to come here with boats.
The boatman from Dongrim took that idol with him.
There is a temple of Rama in Dongrim, there is a dome of Maruti near the temple, he installed the idol in that dome.
"Sangekara Pav" is said while seeing the idol.
Major timber merchants were Abdulbhai, Shilest Bhatkar and Shiva Tari (Panglodad).
Abdulbhai's dress was a dhoti, shirt, coat and a black cap, in fact this was the dress of all the Muslim community.
Apart from the pants, which existed since the Portuguese Amdani, Christians also wore the same garb.
Black caps are common and older men tie handkerchiefs or fetas.
Many boats come to this area to carry wood.

<!-- 8 -->

If you want to go to Panaji by such a boat, after going to Sanvordem, you would get a Vaphor (ferry boat). This steamer ran on kerosene.
If they wanted to go somewhere in the neighboring villages, they used a bullock cart or 'Machule', a palanquin-like vehicle.
Since boats were coming up to the bridge, the main route was by bullock cart.
After the bridge was built, the road was not paved for several years.
There was no need for it, because there were no vehicles to go on the road.
The construction of the bridge should also be done so that the contractor can get work.
The contractor was from Portugal.
He brought labour from Africa for construction.
These labourers of giant bodies were completely naked.
Porridge (pez) was cooked for them in huge pots on the river bank.
Add any vegetables to that porridge.
The food prepared in this way was called "Ranch".
The road was finally asphalted in 1942.
However it was not used for many more years because there were no vehicles.
The first two-wheeler in the village was owned by Mr. Dinanath Nadkarni.

Village temples

Vithoba Temple :-
It was built in the planet Patankar with the help of local citizens.
He hails from Priol village of Patankar origin.
They used to buy spice crops from villages and sell them to Portuguese traders.
Once he made an agreement to supply miri to these traders.
After a few days, fungus had grown on the pepper.
He remembered the universe. As soon as the goods went free, the shame of breaking the contract was revealed.
It was also not possible to bring meeri from somewhere else and give it to them because they bought meeri from the localities.
At night he had a revelation.
On the second day, he bit his hand.
After taking oil and rubbing Miri, Miri looked as good as before.
They immediately cleaned all the miri.
He immediately cleared away all the miri and completed the contract when the Portuguese traders arrived as planned.

<!-- 10 -->

Believing that God had saved him from this great crisis, he decided to spend the rest of his life at the feet of Panduranga and he left for Pandharpura.
On the way, they had to stay in Sange villages.
Here he had a revelation at night and was instructed to build a temple here without going any further.
At that time, the temple was built with the help of the locals, and the Ashtagraharva Comunidad had donated five hundred rupees for this purpose.
When the temple was completed, a discussion started about where to bring the idols to be kept in the gabhars, they had another revelation and brought the idols from Shigone in Bhati village.
A family named Gawli lived in Shigone.
Now they are blind.
He helped excavate and remove the idol.
At that time, they invited him to Kalotsava and when he arrived, he was requested to hold the ropes for pulling the chariot first.
This practice continues till today.

<!-- 11 -->

Utsavamurthy to be installed in the palanquin Shri. Patankar brought from his home while coming; Yes, she was being seated in the palanquin.
Someone recently provided a new idol.
The last descendant of Patankar living here is Mr. Narayan' Patankar. Later, his late Kashinath Patankar was living in Mumbai.
Used to come here from time to time.
Mr. Narayan Patankar was quite an astrologer.
He started a magazine called "Jyotir Vigyan".
Interestingly, he was printing this magazine in his own printing house at Sange.
Every issue of this magazine was in our collection.
One of the Patankars, Bayane, one of the Patankars, came here to take care of the house and the temple, and his close relatives Bakre came here and the Bakre family also settled here.


Paikdev Temple :-
Paikdev temple is located very close to the present site where there is a big tree of ghotingam tree, and a fence is built around it.

<!-- 12 -->

In the year nineteen twenty-two Mr. Vishnu Bhise (who later settled at Kasavali) took the initiative and built it in the present place while renovating it, and sixty years later in the year 1919, this new temple was built.
A miracle happened while building the new temple.
After the walls of the sanctum sanctorum were completed, the cement was removed, but the next day, the cement on the wall behind the idol had fallen off, and the area had formed an eye-like shape.
Immediately the cement was removed again and the lime was also removed, but the same thing happened again and that too at the same place.
This happened three times in total.
Finally, when he took the prasad, it was the Brahmin of the place - the snake - who was upset that he had no place to go in front of the idol.
One thing is true that the ancient temple did not have a sanctum sanctorum.
Later on, two open niches were made at the back of the idol.
After that this type was stopped.

<!-- 13 -->

Datta Temple :-
Sapre family started worshiping it by building a small temple here in 1874 and it was restored in December 1978.

Paikamand :-
This is the mother-in-law of Lord Paikdev.
The Saraswat Brahmin community of the village maintains it.
Recently this building has been beautifully renovated.

Ramnath Temple:-
Palevi of Sri Ramnath Vatya of Ramanathamal, Sateri of Kotarli.
Population came to recent areas due to fever epidemics.
Ramnath was lonely.
Despite being the village god, no one questioned him and the main part of the village, which was once deserted, has come to the Ramanathamal area.

<!-- 14 -->

As mentioned in the beginning, when our ancestors settled at Bena, this surrounding area was uninhabited.
It is not even that they founded the Sanguem village, because there were Marathas and Masurkars before them who owned large tracts of land at Damal and Cotarli.
Eventually the ownership of both lands passed to the Miranda family.
Our grandfather sold the lands around Samprat's^ Paikdev temple, the later plantation around it, and the palace next to it to the same Miranda.
After a few years some of the villagers approached Miranda (he was then a judge in Bicholim court) and requested them to give this land as alms for God, and he agreed to give it.
In return, he only asked to do a prayer every year for the good of his family.

Sancordekar Nadkarni and Surlakar Nadkarni came here after us.
Kosambes and Salelkars followed.
Vaishya families settled in the market area.
In such a manner the village was buzzing.

<!-- 15 -->

We Benkar Nadkarni were the land owners of all these areas.
You may wonder, how come all this land came under our ownership?
Did we buy it from someone or did someone give it to us?
I wondered this myself, but I didn't raise it with anyone, because as I was told that our own land was no longer ours after our grandfather had sold it.
Someone would have said that he is raising this question because he does not have land.
A well-educated youth of our family also once posed this question to me.
Where did these lands come to our ancestors, did they buy them? That was his question.
As I kept researching this, I found the answer.
In ancient times, the royal people i.e. Kshatriyas used to conquer territories by fighting.
They assigned the task of managing this conquered territory to the Brahmins or the Peshwas.

<!-- 16 -->

They then used to collect the revenue of this region and deposit it in the government treasury.
This is called as the Sara of the land.
Later this was called as Predial after the Portuguese income.
This Predial is still paid by these landlords.
In terms of land, this area seems insignificant.
But the word negligible has been coined in this regard.
Because where was the price of land before?
No one has taken money from the citizens who have settled here, the land where many government offices have been built.
To give an example, take all the land of the Paikdev temple when it was decided to donate it to God.
Antonio Miranda said that he bought the land from these people but did not formally deed it.
Then the villagers should now get a donation letter from their heirs.
Our father and his sister immediately consented and gave him the deed.
This story is from the year 1954.
Even 55 years ago, the land had no value.

<!-- 17 -->


A glimpse of the value of money and land in the olden days

Our home Ganeshotsav is common.
But Kikirbamb (Father of K. Avandhoot Nadkarni who worked in Union Bank) used to look after its arrangement, responsibility and expenditure side.
Anjunan also his own family Sangle' some Banghete.
The remaining families bring camphor, incense, matvi fruits.
Nevedya does and shows.
But the responsibility is on his family.
Of course, financial provision was also made for this festival.
Piedad Fernandis (Bhantkar) received three and a half rupees, Pandurang Bakre three and a half rupees, Salelkar family one rupee and twelve annas.
This was a total of fourteen rupees. But it is not known from anyone who is left.
I myself used to go and fetch this money from the above mentioned.
These people were paying for the land they were given.
From this we understand what was the value of money and land in earlier times.

<!-- 18 -->

If there was a dispute between anyone in the village, it was resolved by going to Kosambe.
The reason for going to Kosambe was that because he was a physician, he was respected, but also because our elders liked to sit comfortably.
This tension would come to us only if it was not resolved there.
That means the court and the High Court.
Now if it doesn't settle here too, then the Supreme Court, Raje Saundhekar of Nagesh. Sanguem, Quepem, Ponda and Canacona four talukas in Goa (they were called Novas Conquistas -- New Conquests) were ruled by Saundhekars.
The Portuguese ruled Goa for four and a half hundred years only in four taluks (Velhas Conquistas -- Old Conquests) namely Salcete, Tiswadi (Ilhas), Mormugao and Bardez.
He bought the above four talukas along with Sanguem from the Sondhekars after three and a half hundred years, i.e. only one hundred years before moving from Goa.
